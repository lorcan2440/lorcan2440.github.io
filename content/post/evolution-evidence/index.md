## PALEONTOLOGY

Fossils are remnants of long-dead life and provide a tangible record of the distant past. We can compare  fossilised structures and estimate fossil age using radiometric dating of nearby ash layers to help piece together evolutionary lineages, which can be cross-checked against more precise genetic studies. Taken together, they serve as signposts of how lineages changed over time.

## BIOANTHROPOLOGY AND PRIMATOLOGY

Human evolution is an especially well-studied topic. We are primates and great apes, and there is an abundance of fossils to tell us how our lineages developed over time. Genus *Homo* arose from the prior genus *Australopithecus* about 2.5 million years ago, and following a period filled with numerous species of *Homo*, our species *Homo sapiens* emerged about 300,000 years ago. Our close relationship with chimpanzees, gorillas and bonobos make them great for studying behaviour, too.

## EVOLUTIONARY DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY

How is it that every cell in your body has the same DNA, yet different body parts can have completely different functions? How does your body know where to put everything? Development from an embryo is a tightly-regulated process, with the goal of controlling what genes get expressed where and when. There is a close relationship between evolutionary diversity and developmental diversity, and so we can study one to learn about the other.

{{< figure src="embryology.jpg" title="Humans possess tails in early development because they descend from a common ancestor which had tails. The tail serves no purpose and normally regresses by week 8 of a pregnancy. It is therefore a vestigial trait." >}}

## GENETICS

Genetic similarity between organisms is indicative of evolutionary relatedness, since mutation accumulate within lineages and are passed on to offspring. Studying the genomes of extant life therefore informs evolutionary history.

## DIRECT OBSERVATION

Microevolution (adaptation and other changes within a species) is commonly observed, but the more striking consequences of evolution usually takes place on timescales far too long to observe from start to finish. However, there are some well-established cases where macroevolution can be observed in real time. Some definitions here will be useful:

- *Biological species concept* \~ a species is any group who is reproductively isolated from other such groups, due to e.g. behavioural isolation, genetic incompatibility or failure to produce viable offspring. This is the most common species concept for studying extant life, but is undefined for asexual organisms (prokaryotes), so another concept is required.
- *Phylogenetic species concept* \~ a species is the smallest monophyletic grouping when performing comparative genomic analysis on a population. This is much more suited for prokaryotes, defining species via genetic similarity.
- *Speciation* \~ formation of more than one species from a population of one species, where *species* is defined suitably using one of the species concepts (like the above).
- *Macroevolution* \~ variations in heritable traits in populations with multiple species over time. Speciation marks the start of macroevolution.

Some examples of macroevolution in real time:

### Lizards evolving placentas

Reptiles are known for usually giving birth via egg-laying (oviparity), but there is evidence that some snakes and lizards (order *Squamata*) transitioned to giving live birth (viviparity) independently and recently. A 'transitional form' between these two modes is 'lecithotrophic viviparity', where the egg and yolk is retained and held wholly within the mother. While observing a population of *Zootoca vivipara* in the Alps, reproductive isolation was found between these two subgroups, and attempts at producing hybrids in the lab led to embryonic malformations. The oviparous group is now confined to the range spanning northern Spain and southern France (the Pyrenees), while the viviparous lizards extend across most of Europe.

### Fruit flies feeding on apples

The apple maggot fly (*Rhagoletis pomonella*) usually feeds on the berries of hawthorn trees, and is named after apples only because eastern American/Canadian apple growers in 1864 found its maggots feeding on their trees. Since then, the apple-eating and berry-eating groups have become more distinct. This is a case of 'sympatric speciation': the geographic range of the apple group (north-eastern America) is contained within that of the berry group (temperate biomes globally). There is a barrier between the groups because 1) the two trees flower at different times of the year (apples in summer, hawthorns in autumn/fall) so flies must reproduce asynchronously, and 2) each group only lays its eggs on their respective fruit.

### The London Underground mosquito

They were named due to people being bit by them while hiding in the underground tunnels of London's tube train network during the Blitz of World War 2. It's recently been shown that they did *not* first evolve there. It turns out that the ancestral species, *Culex pipiens*, lived above ground, while the new species, *C. p. f. molestus*, evolved in the Middle East \~2000 years ago, adapted to warm and dark below-ground city environments, of which the sealed tunnels of the 1860s London Underground was one. The new species breeds all-year-round, is cold intolerant and bites rats, mice and humans, while the prior species hibernates in winter. This is a case of 'allopatric speciation' (geographic isolation) by 'disruptive selection', a rarer type of natural selection where an intermediate trait is selected against while extreme traits are favoured, leading to rapid separation into a bimodal distribution of the two lifecycles. Cross-breeding the two forms in the lab led to infertile eggs, implying reproductive isolation.

### Multicellularity in Green Algae

'Colonialism' (simple clumping/aggregation of single-celled organisms) is well-known, and does not count as multicellularity. But if the cells become obligately multicellular (lifecycle uses clonal division by mitosis and remain together, and splitting them apart kills the organism), the groundwork for *de novo* multicellularity is laid. This was observed in the lab  by introducing a population of green algae (*Chlamydomonas reinhardtii*, a protist) to cultures of another predatory protist, over a period of 1 year (\~750 generations). The strong selective pressure to defend against predation led to obligate multicellularity in the algae. This process, featuring increasingly large clusters of cells, is well-reflected in the extant clade *Archaeplastida*, which includes green algae (single cell protist), a variety of other colonial protists and plants (complex multicellular).

Another common trait of extant multicellular life is differentiated tissue formation due to cell specialisation. This too has been observed, and represents the formation of complex genetic control systems (by negative feedback loops) as studied by [evolutionary developmental biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_developmental_biology). *Volvox* is a good example, being within clade *Archaeplastida* (above) and having two cell types - one for sexual reproduction, one for phototaxis. Genetics also finds that the famous 'Yamanaka factors' for cell differentiation (as well as many other key innovations like cell-to-cell signaling, adhesion and the innate immune system) in animals inherit from those in choanoflagellates (the closest-related protists to animals and our likely last unicellular ancestors). So, both protist-to-plant and protist-to-animal transitions look pretty reasonable on this alone.

### Darwin's Finches, revisited 150 years later

This is a [textbook example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin%27s_finches) of bird microevolution from Darwin's 1830s voyage of the Gal√°pagos islands, but studies from the 1980s onwards have identified speciation in the '[Big Bird lineage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bird_(finch))' on Daphne Major island. Regional droughts which reduce seed dispersal to the islands, such as those that occurred in 1977 and 2004, as well as arrival of competitors, were found to be drivers of selection for beak stiffness. The new lineage of finches reproduces only with its own.

### Salamanders, a classic ring species

A '[ring species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_species)' is a rare and aesthetically-pleasing display of speciation wherein a population living outside a circular barrier (e.g. the sands surrounding a lagoon) sequentially mutates and migrates around the circle, so that when they meet up again on the other side, they cannot interbreed. One of the most well-known cases of this is the salamander *Ensatina eschscholtzii*, which spread around the edge of a dry uninhabitable valley in California. A total of seven subspecies of these salamanders developed around the circle, two of which cannot interbreed with each other. Actually, this case is *not* a 'true' ring species, as the diversification process was more complex than simply continuously spreading around the circle, but it still does represent an example of complete speciation.

This process took millions of years, so it wasn't *directly* observed, but the studies showing interbreeding capability of neighbouring subspecies despite isolation between two were done in the present, so it's pretty conclusive as to what happened.

### Greenish Warbler, another ring species

This is another ring species, and one that is *closer* to a true ring species than the Californian salamanders (though still not a perfect ring species - it seems there are no simple true cases!). These birds, *Phylloscopus trochiloides*, inhabit the closed boundary of the Tibetan Plateau, of which two reproductively isolated forms co-exist in central Siberia. Genetic studies find some degree of selection against interbreeding, contributing to the speciation process. This happened over about a million years, so we're using the phylogenetic species concept here.

### Hybrid plants and polyploidy

*Tragopogon miscellus* are 'allopolyploid' plants (multiple sets of chromosomes, some from another species) that formed repeatedly during the past 80 years following the introduction of three diploids species from Europe to the US. This new species has become established in the wild and reproduces on its own. The crossbreeding process that we have used to make new fruits and crops more generally exploits polyploidy (e.g. cultivated strawberries) to enhance susceptibility to selection for desired traits.

### Crocodiles and chickens growing feathers

In the lab, a change in the expression patterns (controlled by upstream genes) of two regulatory genes led to crocodiles developing feathers on their skin instead of scales. These occur via the 'Sonic hedgehog' (Shh) pathway, one of the many developmental cascades activated by homeotic genes. The phenotypes observed in these experiments closely resembled those of the unusual filamentous appendages found in the fossils of some feathered dinosaurs, as if transitional.

A similar thing has been done to turn the chickens' scales on their feet into feathers, this time with only one change to the Shh pathway, showing how birds are indeed dinosaurs and descend within *Sauropsida*.

### Endosymbiosis in an amoeba

There is excessive evidence that the organelles like mitochondria and chloroplasts (and more recently discovered, the [nitroplast](https://asm.org/articles/2024/june/beyond-endosymbiosis-discovering-first-nitroplast)) found within extant eukaryotes were originally free-living prokaryotes, which became incorporated (endosymbiosis), but no such thing had been observed, until now. The bacterial order *Legionellales* are responsible for Legionnaire's disease and live in water, but are uniquely able to survive and reproduce even after being 'eaten' by some amoebae before returning to free-living conditions. In the lab, it was found that some strains of wild amoeboid protists in clade *Rhizaria*, class *Thecofilosea*, were transmitting fully-incorporated *Legionellales* vertically by cell division. Extracellular transmission of bacteria was not observed, indicating mutualistic endosymbiosis, and genetic studies confirmed divergence of the endosymbiont via a shrinkage of its genome (as expected) and gene translocation to the protist's nuclear DNA.

### Eurasian Blackcap

The migratory bird *Sylvia atricapilla* typically flies either south-westerly towards Spain or south-easterly into Asia as winter approaches in Europe, but the rise of birdwatching as a hobby in the UK in the 1960s led to a new food source in Britain that the westerly-flying birds could migrate to. This change is known to be genetic in basis. Those that instead migrated to the British Isles in winter returned home 10 days earlier (due to the shorter distance to central Europe) than those that went towards Spain, and therefore would mate only with themselves (sympatric speciation). The UK-migrating group now has rounder wings and narrower, longer beaks, over just \~30 generations, and although genetic differentiation has not yet reached the point of preventing interbreeding entirely, these birds are quite clearly well on their way to speciation.

## GENETICS

Genetic similarity between organisms is indicative of evolutionary relatedness, since mutation accumulate within lineages and are passed on to offspring. Studying the genomes of extant life therefore informs evolutionary history.

## PALEONTOLOGY

Fossils are remnants of long-dead life and provide a tangible record of the distant past. We can compare  fossilised structures and estimate fossil age using radiometric dating of nearby ash layers to help piece together evolutionary lineages, which can be cross-checked against more precise genetic studies. Taken together, they serve as signposts of how lineages changed over time.

## EVOLUTIONARY DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY

How is it that every cell in your body has the same DNA, yet different body parts can have completely different functions? How does your body know where to put everything? Development from an embryo is a tightly-regulated process, with the goal of controlling what genes get expressed where and when. There is a close relationship between evolutionary diversity and developmental diversity, and so we can study one to learn about the other.

## BIOANTHROPOLOGY AND PRIMATOLOGY

Human evolution is an especially well-studied topic. We are primates and great apes, and there is an abundance of fossils to tell us how our lineages developed over time. Genus *Homo* arose from the prior genus *Australopithecus* about 2.5 million years ago, and following a period filled with numerous species of *Homo*, our species *Homo sapiens* emerged about 300,000 years ago. Our close relationship with chimpanzees, gorillas and bonobos make them great for studying behaviour, too.

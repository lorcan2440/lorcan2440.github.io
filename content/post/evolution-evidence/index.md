## DIRECT OBSERVATION

Microevolution (adaptation and other changes within a species) is commonly observed, but the more striking consequences of evolution usually take place on timescales far too long to observe from start to finish. However, there are some well-established cases where macroevolution can be observed in real time. Some definitions here will be useful:

- *Biological species concept* \~ a species is any group who is reproductively isolated from other such groups, due to e.g. behavioural isolation, genetic incompatibility or failure to produce viable offspring. This is the most common species concept for studying extant life, but is undefined for asexual organisms (prokaryotes), so another concept is required.
- *Phylogenetic species concept* \~ a species is the smallest monophyletic grouping when performing comparative genomic analysis on a population. This is much more suited for prokaryotes, defining species via genetic similarity.
- *Speciation* \~ formation of more than one species from a population of one species, where *species* is defined suitably using one of the species concepts (like the above).
- *Macroevolution* \~ variations in heritable traits in populations with multiple species over time. Speciation marks the start of macroevolution.

Although microevolution is useful for conceptualising how Darwinian evolution works (e.g. adaptation: heritable changes with natural selection), it is somewhat trivial and is not contested by critics of evolutionary theory. Therefore, we will list here only examples of macroevolution that have been observed in real time. Most of these are in the wild, with a few lab-based studies included too. Also included are some counterexamples to 'irreducible complexity', the idea from 'intelligent design' that some structures are too complex to have evolved from simpler predecessors. These are not usually macroevolution, but they do show how evolution is capable of producing complex structures, which is a common sticking point.

### [A1] Lizards evolving placentas

Reptiles are known for usually giving birth via egg-laying (oviparity), but there is evidence that some snakes and lizards (order *Squamata*) transitioned to giving live birth (viviparity) independently and recently. A 'transitional form' between these two modes is 'lecithotrophic viviparity', where the egg and yolk is retained and held wholly within the mother. While observing a population of *Zootoca vivipara* in the Alps, reproductive isolation was found between these two subgroups, and attempts at producing hybrids in the lab led to embryonic malformations. The oviparous group is now confined to the range spanning northern Spain and southern France (the Pyrenees), while the viviparous lizards extend across most of Europe.

### [A2] Fruit flies feeding on apples

The apple maggot fly (*Rhagoletis pomonella*) usually feeds on the berries of hawthorn trees, and is named after apples only because eastern American/Canadian apple growers in 1864 found its maggots feeding on their trees. Since then, the apple-eating and berry-eating groups have become more distinct. This is a case of 'sympatric speciation': the geographic range of the apple group (north-eastern America) is contained within that of the berry group (temperate biomes globally). There is a barrier between the groups because 1) the two trees flower at different times of the year (apples in summer, hawthorns in autumn/fall) so flies must reproduce asynchronously, and 2) each group only lays its eggs on their respective fruit.

### [A3] The London Underground mosquito

They were named due to people being bit by them while hiding in the underground tunnels of London's tube train network during the Blitz of World War 2. It's recently been shown that they did *not* first evolve there. It turns out that the ancestral species, *Culex pipiens*, lived above ground, while the new species, *C. p. f. molestus*, evolved in the Middle East \~2000 years ago, adapted to warm and dark below-ground city environments, of which the sealed tunnels of the 1860s London Underground was one. The new species breeds all-year-round, is cold intolerant and bites rats, mice and humans, while the prior species hibernates in winter. This is a case of 'allopatric speciation' (geographic isolation) by 'disruptive selection', a rarer type of natural selection where an intermediate trait is selected against while extreme traits are favoured, leading to rapid separation into a bimodal distribution of the two lifecycles. Cross-breeding the two forms in the lab led to infertile eggs, implying reproductive isolation.

### [A4] Multicellularity in Green Algae

'Colonialism' (simple clumping/aggregation of single-celled organisms) is well-known, and does not count as multicellularity. But if the cells become obligately multicellular (lifecycle uses clonal division by mitosis and remain together, and splitting them apart kills the organism), the groundwork for *de novo* multicellularity is laid. This was observed in the lab  by introducing a population of green algae (*Chlamydomonas reinhardtii*, a protist) to cultures of another predatory protist, over a period of 1 year (\~750 generations). The strong selective pressure to defend against predation led to obligate multicellularity in the algae. This process, featuring increasingly large clusters of cells, is well-reflected in the extant clade *Archaeplastida*, which includes green algae (single cell protist), a variety of other colonial protists and plants (complex multicellular).

Another common trait of extant multicellular life is differentiated tissue formation due to cell specialisation. This too has been observed, and represents the formation of complex genetic control systems (by negative feedback loops) as studied by [evolutionary developmental biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_developmental_biology). *Volvox* is a good example, being within clade *Archaeplastida* (above) and having two cell types - one for sexual reproduction, one for phototaxis. Genetics also finds that the famous 'Yamanaka factors' for cell differentiation (as well as many other key innovations like cell-to-cell signaling, adhesion and the innate immune system) in animals inherit from those in choanoflagellates (the closest-related protists to animals and our likely last unicellular ancestors). So, both protist-to-plant and protist-to-animal transitions look pretty reasonable on this alone.

### [A5] Darwin's Finches, revisited 150 years later

This is a [textbook example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin%27s_finches) of bird microevolution from Darwin's 1830s voyage of the Galápagos islands, but studies from the 1980s onwards have identified speciation in the '[Big Bird lineage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bird_(finch))' on Daphne Major island. Regional droughts which reduce seed dispersal to the islands, such as those that occurred in 1977 and 2004, as well as arrival of competitors, were found to be drivers of selection for beak stiffness. The new lineage of finches reproduces only with its own.

### [A6] Salamanders, a classic ring species

A '[ring species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_species)' is a rare and aesthetically-pleasing display of speciation wherein a population living outside a circular barrier (e.g. the sands surrounding a lagoon) sequentially mutates and migrates around the circle, so that when they meet up again on the other side, they cannot interbreed. One of the most well-known cases of this is the salamander *Ensatina eschscholtzii*, which spread around the edge of a dry uninhabitable valley in California. A total of seven subspecies of these salamanders developed around the circle, two of which cannot interbreed with each other. Actually, this case is *not* a 'true' ring species, as the diversification process was more complex than simply continuously spreading around the circle, but it still does represent an example of complete speciation.

This process took millions of years, so it wasn't *directly* observed, but the studies showing interbreeding capability of neighbouring subspecies despite isolation between two were done in the present, so it's pretty conclusive as to what happened.

### [A7] Greenish Warbler, another ring species

This is another ring species, and one that is *closer* to a true ring species than the Californian salamanders (though still not a perfect ring species - it seems there are no simple true cases!). These birds, *Phylloscopus trochiloides*, inhabit the closed boundary of the Tibetan Plateau, of which two reproductively isolated forms co-exist in central Siberia. Genetic studies find some degree of selection against interbreeding, contributing to the speciation process. This happened over about a million years, so we're using the phylogenetic species concept here.

### [A8] Hybrid plants and polyploidy

*Tragopogon miscellus* are 'allopolyploid' plants (multiple sets of chromosomes, some from another species) that formed repeatedly during the past 80 years following the introduction of three diploids species from Europe to the US. This new species has become established in the wild and reproduces on its own. The crossbreeding process that we have used to make new fruits and crops more generally exploits polyploidy (e.g. cultivated strawberries) to enhance susceptibility to selection for desired traits.

### [A9] Crocodiles and chickens growing feathers

In the lab, a change in the expression patterns (controlled by upstream genes) of two regulatory genes led to crocodiles developing feathers on their skin instead of scales. These occur via the 'Sonic hedgehog' (Shh) pathway, one of the many developmental cascades activated by homeotic genes. The phenotypes observed in these experiments closely resembled those of the unusual filamentous appendages found in the fossils of some feathered dinosaurs, as if transitional.

A similar thing has been done to turn the chickens' scales on their feet into feathers, this time with only one change to the Shh pathway, showing how birds are indeed dinosaurs and descend within *Sauropsida*.

### [A10] Endosymbiosis in an amoeba

There is excessive evidence that the organelles like mitochondria and chloroplasts (and more recently discovered, the [nitroplast](https://asm.org/articles/2024/june/beyond-endosymbiosis-discovering-first-nitroplast)) found within extant eukaryotes were originally free-living prokaryotes, which became incorporated (endosymbiosis), but no such thing had been observed, until now. The bacterial order *Legionellales* are responsible for Legionnaire's disease and live in water, but are uniquely able to survive and reproduce even after being 'eaten' by some amoebae before returning to free-living conditions. In the lab, it was found that some strains of wild amoeboid protists in clade *Rhizaria*, class *Thecofilosea*, were transmitting fully-incorporated *Legionellales* vertically by cell division. Extracellular transmission of bacteria was not observed, indicating mutualistic endosymbiosis, and genetic studies confirmed divergence of the endosymbiont via a shrinkage of its genome (as expected) and gene translocation to the protist's nuclear DNA.

### [A11] Eurasian Blackcap

The migratory bird *Sylvia atricapilla* typically flies either south-westerly towards Spain or south-easterly into Asia as winter approaches in Europe, but the rise of birdwatching as a hobby in the UK in the 1960s led to a new food source in Britain that the westerly-flying birds could migrate to. This change is known to be genetic in basis. Those that instead migrated to the British Isles in winter returned home 10 days earlier (due to the shorter distance to central Europe) than those that went towards Spain, and therefore would mate only with themselves (sympatric speciation). The UK-migrating group now has rounder wings and narrower, longer beaks, over just \~30 generations, and although genetic differentiation has not yet reached the point of preventing interbreeding entirely, these birds are quite clearly well on their way to speciation.

Another collection of observed cases of macroevolution is given [here](https://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-speciation.html) and [here](https://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/speciation.html), known for several decades now. Some examples of reducible complexity are as follows:

### [A12] E. Coli Citrate Metabolism in the LTEE

The [Lenski long-term evolution experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._coli_long-term_evolution_experiment) (LTEE) is a famous study that's been ongoing since 1988, following 12 initially-identical but separate lines of *E. coli* bacteria over 80,000+ generations thus far. There are no external selective pressures in the LTEE, so the experiment is about what the bacteria could do on their own. Among the outcomes include *de novo* gene birth from non-coding DNA and near-complete speciation into two variants with differing colony size, but most importantly, one line evolved the ability to eat citrate (Cit) in aerobic conditions, a trait universally absent in wild-type *E. coli*. This led to an immediate rise in population density.

Contrary to the claims of top intelligent design (ID) proponents (e.g. Dr Michael Behe), this is *not* merely due to the loss of regulation of *CitT* (the relevant gene) expression, which would constitute a *loss* of function. In fact, the *CitT* gene was in an operon controlled by an anaerobically-active promoter, and underwent gene duplication, and the duplicate was inserted downstream of an aerobically-active promoter. This is therefore a *gain* of functionality. However, this duplication conferred a negligible (\~1%) fitness advantage in the experiment, and at least two other mutations (in an intron of the *dctA* gene after, and in the *gltA* gene before) were shown to be necessary to obtain fully-functional citrate metabolism. This therefore meets the criteria for an "irreducibly complex" trait - and it's one that emerged under experimental conditions normally adverse to innovation (stasis)!

In an amusing attempt to refute this, ID advocate Scott Minnich (works at Discovery Institute, a [politically-motivated creationist organisation](https://ncse.ngo/wedge-document)) reproduced the experiment in 2016 with a new colony of wild-type *E. coli* and found the same Cit+ trait emerge! And this time, much faster than in the LTEE, via the same pathway, featuring *CitT* and *dctA*. The abstract of their paper ends rather desperately: "We conclude that the rarity of the LTEE mutant was an artifact of the experimental conditions and not a unique evolutionary event. No new genetic information (novel gene function) evolved." - despite us having disproven that already.

### [A13] Tetherin antagonism in HIV groups M and O

The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) groups O and M evolved two different new ways to use their proteins Nef and Vpu to infect humans. Normally, HIV infects the helper T-cells of our immune system, reproducing within them and weakening them due to its retroviral activity. If HIV infects a different immune cell, the virus is hampered due to a protein called tetherin, which prevents its escape. However, the subgroups O and M of HIV evolved a way to antagonise tetherin, increasing viral infection capability, without the loss of its CD4-degrading activity. In group M, this required *at least* 4 concurrent point mutations in the *Vpu* protein, and in group O, this required just 1 mutation in the *Nef* protein (serine at position 169 became cysteine). So, the same trait evolved two ways, one of which (group M) was supposedly irreducibly complex. Group M now dominates worldwide HIV cases while group O resides mainly in sub-Saharan Africa.

Incidentally, HIV also simultaneously demonstrates observed 'macroevolution' (to the extent that it can be defined for viruses, which are not life). HIV has a 'zoonotic' (animal) origin, as it came from SIV (simian immunodeficiency virus). SIV infects many non-human primates, including the great apes, but became human transmissible as HIV in the early 1900s due to mutations that allowed it to bind our CD4 receptors, which differ slightly between humans and other apes.

### [A14] Human lactose tolerance

In lactose intolerant people (\~65% of humans worldwide), the ability to digest lactose is lost during adolescence. The lactase enzyme is required to metabolise lactose into glucose and galactose. Without lactase in the small intestine, lactose remains available for the bacteria in the large intestine which ferment it, leading to fatty acid and gas production, causing symptoms of lactose intolerance.

The *LCT* gene codes for lactase, and has a low-affinity promoter. The *MCM6* gene, found upstream on chromosome 2, codes for a subunit of helicase (an unrelated protein used in DNA replication), and an intron of *MCM6* contains an enhancer for *LCT*. Transcription factors that bind to the *LCT* promoter include HNF1-α, GATA and CDX-2, while Oct1 binds to the *LCT* enhancer.

In mammals, most metabolic genes except lactase are expressed at low levels early in development as nutrients are provided primarily by breast milk, but during adolescence, as these other genes are promoted, low-affinity promoters like *LCT* are outcompeted, sharply reducing *LCT* expression. In lactase persistence, point mutations to the *LCT* enhancer result in an increased affinity for the *LCT* promoter, allowing it to remain competitive for transcription throughout life, allowing lifelong lactase synthesis. So, this is *not* a loss of regulation or function, as routinely claimed by ID advocates. Some mutations also reduce the age-related DNA methylation of the enhancer. Lactase persistence has evolved independently with several SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) under strong positive selection in the past 10,000 years of human history, primarily in societies that had dairy farming and pastoralist agriculture.

### [A15] Re-evolution of bacterial flagella

The flagellum is the flagship allegedly irreducibly complex structure, cited ad nauseum by ID advocates. Since it is the one that has been talked about the most, it has also attracted a lot of attention from real scientists who have promptly disarmed it. In one experiment, the master regulator for flagellum synthesis (FleQ) was knocked out, leaving all of the other flagellar genes intact. But under selective pressure for motility, it was found that another transcription factor that regulates nitrogen uptake from the same protein family (NtrC) was able to 'substitute' for FleQ, essentially by becoming hyperexpressed, so there's so much NtrC in the cell that some of it binds to the FleQ-regulated genes and activates them too.

This is an incredibly reliable two-step process, after 24-48 hours we get a mutation in one of the genes upstream of NtrC that leads to higher expression and activation, then within 96 hours of the start we see a second mutation, normally within NtrC itself, that helps fine-tune the expression.

### [A16] Ecological succession

This is fun one to bring up in the context of 'creationism vs evolution', as it refers to the macroscopic and very well-accepted process of '[primary succession](https://news.uchicago.edu/explainer/what-is-ecological-succession#:~:text=and%20secondary%20succession.-,Primary%20succession,-happens%20when%20a)'. This describes the sequence that follows formation of a new region of land (well-studied in physical geography) as life moves in for the first time. The resulting ecosystems that form (in the 'climax community') are highly interdependent, such that removing one would collapse the whole food web, which is a defining feature of irreducible complexity. Yet, we watch it happen all the time - and this is something that must have happened regardless of whether creation or evolution is true!

Sources for A16: [here](https://news.uchicago.edu/explainer/what-is-ecological-succession) (article), [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06154) and [here](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3545904).

*If* macroevolution can be observed, *and* we know of no means by which the mechanisms of neo-Darwinian evolution (mutation/selection/drift/gene flow) can stop, *and* we have consilient evidence indicating continuation of the process back through time, *and* there is no reason to believe any contrary explanations (e.g. intelligent design/creationism), *then* the methodologically naturalistic, parsimonious, evidence-driven conclusion follows.

Direct observations are not the *best evidence* of evolution as a whole. Direct observation is just one line of inquiry: the other lines (below) serve to justify and corroborate the extrapolation of those observations through deep time, synthesising the theory of evolution as we know it.

## GENETICS

Genetic similarity between organisms is indicative of evolutionary relatedness, since mutation accumulate within lineages and are passed on to offspring. Studying the genomes of extant life therefore informs evolutionary history.

## PALEONTOLOGY

Fossils are remnants of long-dead life and provide a tangible record of the distant past. We can compare  fossilised structures and estimate fossil age using radiometric dating of nearby ash layers to help piece together evolutionary lineages, which can be cross-checked against more precise genetic studies. Taken together, they serve as signposts of how lineages changed over time.

## EVOLUTIONARY DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY

How is it that every cell in your body has the same DNA, yet different body parts can have completely different functions? How does your body know where to put everything? Development from an embryo is a tightly-regulated process, with the goal of controlling what genes get expressed where and when. There is a close relationship between evolutionary diversity and developmental diversity, and so we can study one to learn about the other.

## BIOANTHROPOLOGY AND PRIMATOLOGY

Human evolution is an especially well-studied topic. We are primates and great apes, and there is an abundance of fossils to tell us how our lineages developed over time. Genus *Homo* arose from the prior genus *Australopithecus* about 2.5 million years ago, and following a period filled with numerous species of *Homo*, our species *Homo sapiens* emerged about 300,000 years ago. Our close relationship with chimpanzees, gorillas and bonobos make them great for studying behaviour, too.

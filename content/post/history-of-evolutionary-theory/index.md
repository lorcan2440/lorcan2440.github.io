Once you've learned a certain amount of science, it's often fun to turn over to the history of science and see how it all fits together in a historical context. You can often find a newfound sense of appreciation for the scientific process and how we came to learn so much despite the limited technology of the past.

Chemistry's atomic theory is commonly taught in schools as a simplified demonstration of the way science progresses, which I expanded upon in [a previous post](/post/history-of-atomic-theory/). But evolutionary theory follows a similarly fascinating but far more non-linear trajectory of proposal, debate, acceptance, more debate, rejection, more debate, alteration, more debate, re-acceptance, refinement, etc etc, which is much less commonly taught. Detractors of the theory of evolution (i.e. creationists) often accuse evolution of being dogmatic and elitist, but the history clearly proves otherwise.

Here's my attempt at putting together all the key developments, ideas, controversies and related issues to the history of scientific thought on evolution. The good, the bad, the ugly, no sugarcoating, no BS, just the facts and the benefit of hindsight for commentary.

## Part 1: Pre-Darwinian Thought

**Spontaneous Generation** (Aristotle, 300s BC). The belief held (in some form) throughout most of the Middle Ages that small organisms such as larvae of insects and worms could be produced from decaying flesh of larger organisms. In 1665, Redi left meat to rot in a gauze-sealed jar and observed flies laid their eggs to hatch on the gauze, showing they were not generated from the meat. In 1859, Pasteur boiled a meat broth and showed it remained sterile, becoming contaminated when air was allowed to enter. Pasteur proposed the ‘law of biogenesis’ (current life can only arise from pre-existing life) in 1860.

**Preformationism** (Hippocrates, 400s BC and Swammerdam and Malpighi, late 1600s). Hippocrates proposed that all life develops from smaller versions of itself. Early microscopy experiments in the 1700s led to the idea of a ‘homunculus’ as a ‘mini-human’. This was strongly influenced by creationism, as the solution to the infinite regress was proposed as the divine creation event.

**Stratigraphy** (Steno, 1669). The ‘law of superposition’ stated that the rocks of the Earth’s crust are deposited in layers, with newer rocks on top of older rocks. This would later provide an approximate way to relatively date fossils found within rocks (biostratigraphy: Smith, 1815).

**Systematic Classification** (Linnaeus, 1735). Noticed that classifying species based on their traits naturally led to a hierarchical structure, known as a taxonomy. Linnaeus specifically noted the striking similarity between humans and great apes. He did not believe species could change over time, and also falsely classified humans into four biologically distinct 'races'.

**Social Degeneration** (Leclerc, 1749). Proposed that species could change over time, with each species having a single original progenitor. Usually associated with degradation due to changing environmental conditions. Leclerc also first recognised ecological succession.

**Epigenesis** (Aristotle, 300s BC and Wolff, 1759). Aristotle proposed that life developed from a seed. Wolff’s more recent concept of epigenesis involved development from a seed, egg or spore, supported by early embryological studies from von Baer. Epigenesis competed with preformationist thought in the late 1700s, although epigenesis was not fully accepted until cell theory in the 1800s.

**Vitalism** (Stahl, 1708 and Wolff, 1759): The belief, roughly traceable back to Aristotle, that living entities are fundamentally distinct from non-life, since life has a special ‘vital force’, and so life (and its processes) cannot be produced or performed by non-living material. It was challenged in 1828 with Wöhler’s synthesis of urea from ammonium cyanate, showing that organic chemistry can be accessed from inorganic chemistry, and was effectively disproven in 1845 with Kolbe’s four-step synthesis of acetic acid from carbon disulfide. Pasteur retained support for vitalism into the 1860s, noting the optical rotation of biogenic (homochiral) versus synthetic (racemic) tartaric acid, and believed fermentation could only be performed in vivo (disproven with yeast extract by Buchner in 1897).

**Uniformitarianism / Actualism** (Hutton, 1785 and Lyell, 1830). The laws of physics in operation today can be extrapolated into the past. In particular, uniformitarianism claims geological changes tend to occur continuously and have taken place steadily over a long period of time. Hutton, as well as Leclerc in 1778, concluded that the Earth was several tens of thousands of years old, the first geology-based rejections of the Ussher chronology that underlies young earth creationism. Actualism allows for brief periods of sudden change, which remains supported by modern geologists.

**Scientific Racism** (Blumenbach, 1795, Gall, 1796 and Morton, 1800s). Blumenbach invented comparative zoology and anthropology, but also created the 'five races' theory, ranking Caucasians (white Europeans) as the most superior. Gall invented the pseudoscience of phrenology, claiming that the races could be distinguished on the basis of skull dimensions. Morton's conclusions were rebutted by physician Tiedemann in 1836, but remained highly influential in support of slavery and white supremacy. In 1854, Nott and Gliddon used Morton's work to support polygenism (the idea that races were created separately by God).

**Mesozoic Fossils** (Mary Anning, 1810s). Anning found many well-preserved fossils of large species never seen before - dinosaurs, large marine reptiles and cephalopods. She was not allowed to publish her findings, with other men taking the credit for it at the time, but these discoveries provided further compelling evidence for old-earth geology.

**Catastrophism** (Cuvier, 1813). Cuvier attributed the discovery of the fossils to catastrophic flooding events, followed by divine creation events to repopulate. The concept of extinction was extremely controversial, as it was thought to break the doctrine of the ‘Great Chain of Being’ or imply imperfection in divine creation (the ‘principle of plenitude’).

**Resource Utilisation** (Malthus, 1798 and Verhulst, 1838). Malthusian economics proposed that competition within overpopulated environments would lead to collapse as resources are consumed without sufficient replacement. Verhulst’s logistic model suggested a steady levelling off of populations at a ‘carrying capacity’, using a differential equation which became the basis for r / K selection theory.

**Lamarckism** (Lamarck, 1830). Proposed that organisms inherit characteristics acquired during their reproductive lifespan, and that this is the primary mode of species change.

## Part 2: Development of the Theory

**Evolution by Natural Selection** (Darwin and Wallace, 1859). Proposed life evolves due to heritable changes in acquired traits followed by natural selection: organisms were designed by their environment, rather than for their environment, with universal common ancestry as the logical inference. Darwin allowed for the possibility of Lamarckian-style inheritance, and incorrectly hypothesised the mechanism of heredity to be ‘pangenesis’ via ‘gemmules’, his attempt to unify preformationist ideas with the recently discovered cell theory.

**Comparative Anatomy** (Huxley, 1860s). Used anatomical homologies to infer common descent, with particular clarity in the vertebrate fossil record. Huxley also promoted ‘Darwinism’ alongside agnosticism among the general public, with debates against theologians (e.g. Wilberforce, 1860, and Owen, 1862) who were critical of the theory.

**Old Earth** (Kelvin, 1862, Perry, 1895, and Patterson, 1956). Earth had been known to be old since the late 1700s, but estimates of the age varied widely. Kelvin’s heat transfer calculation estimated Earth’s age as 20 - 400 million years old, neglecting mantle convection and radiogenic heat, still insufficient for evolutionary timescales. Perry estimated 2 billion years in 1895 accounting for convection. Radiometric dating wasn’t considered reliable by geologists until the 1920s, and in 1956 Patterson used U-Pb radiometric isochron dating on meteorites to conclusively show an age of 4.55 billion years.

**Mendelian Inheritance** (Mendel, 1865). Showed that traits can be inherited, providing a ‘proof of concept’ for genetics. Darwin was unaware of Mendel’s work, and Mendel’s ideas were not recognised for their potential until 1900.

**Social Darwinism and Eugenics** (Galton, 1883). Galton believed that traits such as intelligence, health, and morality were inherited, and that selective breeding could ‘improve’ the human race. This became increasingly politicised and extremised in the 1900s in the US, and in the 1930s in Nazi Germany. Eugenics was banned in the 1930s Soviet Union due to the rise of Lysenkoism (all of genetic theory rejected). Only a few of the ‘modern synthesis’ scientists (Fisher, Huxley, Haldane) expressed support for eugenics, and all except Fisher revoked their support after World War 2, with Haldane becoming a socialist and rejecting eugenics while later criticising Lysenkoism.

**Germ Plasm / Weismann Barrier** (Weismann, 1892). The separation between germline and somatic cells prevents environmental changes from being inherited, contradicting Lamarckism. Popularised by Wallace, and still considered generally valid for most animals.

**Neo-Darwinism** (Romanes, 1895). Historically refers to the modification of Darwinism to account for the Weismann barrier, replacing Lamarckian inheritance with germline mutations. However, the term has been used by more modern writers (Dawkins, Gould) to refer to the early stages of the Modern Synthesis (1920-30s), when natural selection was pitted against other contemporary ideas.

**Mutationism / Saltationism** (de Vries, 1901). The idea that speciation was caused by sudden ‘macro-mutation’ events, which led to immediate cladogenesis, another alternative to natural selection following rediscovery of Mendel’s laws. This was popular in the ‘eclipse of Darwinism’, a period where natural selection was disfavoured and ‘neo-Lamarckian’ ideas reigned, and was proposed as the distinguishing driver of ‘macroevolution’ by Filipchenko in 1927.

**Biometrics** (Galton, Pearson and Wendon, early 1900s). The ‘biometric school’ strongly opposed Mendelian genetics and mutationism, using statistics for the first time to argue for continuous variation in traits. The biometricians were disparagingly referred to as ‘Darwinists’ during this period. In 1918, Fisher proved mathematically that there was no inherent contradiction between Mendel’s laws and statistical methods, leading to the formation of quantitative genetics.

**Orthogenesis** (Coulter, 1915, et al.). Another alternative to natural selection, where organisms are driven teleologically by internal forces to direct evolution in a particular direction.

**Random Mutation** (Luria and Delbrück, 1943). Experimentally showed that mutations accumulate randomly with respect to fitness, decoupling them from the process of natural selection.

**Modern Synthesis** (Fisher, Haldane, Dobzhansky, Wright…, 1937-50). The synthesis of Darwinian selection with Mendelian genetic germline inheritance. Fisher, Haldane and Wright provided the mathematical grounding for population genetics, and introduced the concepts of genetic drift and gene flow. This resulted in the various subfields of natural history converging on a mechanism for change, making ideas such as Lamarckism, mutationism and orthogenesis obsolete.

## Part 3: Modern Theory and Recent Controversies

**Genetic Code** (Miescher, 1871, Griffith, 1928, Watson, Crick and Franklin, 1958). Miescher discovered chromosomes and nucleic acids; Griffith showed its exchange confers traits, and Watson, Crick and Franklin discovered the structure of DNA: its relative simplicity led many scientists to doubt that it carried the genetic code. The ‘central dogma of molecular biology’ (Crick, 1957) stated that DNA sequence information transfer is unidirectional: DNA → RNA → protein, due to codon redundancy.

**Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution** (Kimura, 1968, King & Jukes, 1969 and Ohta, 1976). Kimura proposed that most mutations have negligible effect on fitness and cannot be selected for, and that genetic drift is therefore responsible for the majority of diversity. This elegantly explained polymorphism and contradicted the early 1900s ‘pan-selectionist’ idea that natural selection was an all-powerful force. Ohta modified Kimura’s neutral theory to show that conclusions about drift times to fixation remain valid even when the average fitness effect of mutation is slightly deleterious rather than neutral, allowing for more flexibility in the theory and is widely supported in population genetics.

**Evolutionarily Stable Strategies (ESS)** (Hamilton, 1964, Price, 1972 and Maynard Smith, 1973). Application of game theory to evolution led to the ideas of inclusive fitness and behavioural strategies, explaining altruism and spite. The Price equation generalised and demystified the 'fundamental theorem of natural selection' by Fisher in 1930. Supported by Dawkins due to alignment with his gene-centric view.

**Punctuated Equilibrium** (Gould and Eldredge, 1972 and 1977). The fossil record tends to show long periods of stasis followed by rapid bursts of cladogenesis, which was proposed to be at odds with the expected ‘phyletic gradualism’, but stabilising selection explains it. More recently, the term has been (incorrectly) used to refer to any pattern of alternating rates of evolution, which is already easily explained by differing rates of environmental change, in which newly-opened niches are filled quickly.

**Selfish Genes** (Dawkins, 1976). Proposed that genes are the fundamental unit on which selection acts, rather than organisms, which are the ‘passive vehicles’ which genes use to propagate. It is now considered an overly reductionist view, first criticised as such by Gould.

**Evolutionary Developmental Biology (Evo-Devo)** (Gould, Davidson, Peter, McClintock…, 1970s). Showed how changes in developmental genes can lead to large phenotypic changes, explaining 19th century observations in embryology (Haeckel and Von Baer). The genomic control process is widely accepted as a mechanism of evolving and refining complex traits. It is part of the EES.

**Coalescent Theory** (Kingman, 1982). A powerful statistical framework from population genetics that allows formal inference about the genealogical history of a set of DNA sequences. Ancestral recombination graphs are a core concept in modern evolutionary theory.

**Extended Evolutionary Synthesis (EES)** (Müller, Laland, Jablonka…, 1980s). Aims to incorporate (to varying extents) the concepts of horizontal gene transfer, evo-devo, epigenetics, multi-level selection, niche construction and phenotypic plasticity (via ‘genetic assimilation’) into evolutionary theory. Some EES proponents say these processes dominate evolutionary change, while others believe they are auxiliary to mechanisms of the Modern Synthesis: the latter is the more widely accepted view.

**Intelligent Design (ID)** (Dembski, Behe, Meyer…, 1990s). A pseudoscientific movement portraying modern science as supporting creationism using concepts such as ‘irreducible complexity’. ID recycles ideas from Paley (1802), the US Presbyterian fundamentalist schism (1920s) and the ‘Fourth Great Awakening’ (1970s). Promoted largely by the Discovery Institute, a Christian political ‘think tank’ in an attempt to circumvent the 1987 Edwards v. Aguillard court ruling on banning creationism in public school science curricula, but was once again deemed creationism at Kitzmiller v. Dover (2005). ID is rejected by the entire scientific community, but remains prevalent in the creationist sphere of influence.

**The Third Way / Integrated Synthesis** (Noble & Shapiro, 2014). A more radical branch of the EES proposes evolvability as the primary driving force of evolution, where physiology exhibits strong phenotypic plasticity, termed ‘natural genetic engineering’. This is not acknowledged as a valid theory by the mainstream scientific community. Noble receives funding from the Templeton Foundation, which promotes a variety of contrarian views in science, philosophy and theology.

## Conclusions

Hopefully this goes without saying, but most of the above items are not as simple as "this was right" or "this was wrong". Some are, but most aren't: certain parts of ideas had merit while others were found to be faulty and scrapped. That's how science works. The 'core' of evolutionary theory was more or less solidified with the Modern Synthesis by 1950, but this core was very different to what Darwin proposed originally. The theory hasn't changed all that much since the 1970s, in the grand scheme of things - that's not for lack of criticism (as you can see above!), but rather lack of valid competing evidence: all we've seen is the mountains of evidence piling in, as biology advances exponentially, with all new discoveries validating the theory beyond all reasonable doubt.

So, at what point was there ever a dogma - meaning, an unevidenced idea that can't be challenged and is taken only on authority - in evolutionary theory?

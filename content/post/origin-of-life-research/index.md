## ASTROBIOLOGY, ASTROCHEMISTRY AND GEOCHEMISTRY

Chemical reactions occurring in space, forming the 'building blocks of the building blocks' that were likely present at Earth's formation, or were delivered during the bombardment period that followed. Solid-phase chemistry and transport phenomena enabled by geologic formations may also be relevant.

(2009) '[**Delivery of Complex Organic Compounds from Planetary Nebulae to the Solar System.**](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-journal-of-astrobiology/article/abs/delivery-of-complex-organic-compounds-from-planetary-nebulae-to-the-solar-system/673B6EF557061150FA26DB1A7760FDC0)' *International Journal of Astrobiology*, 8(3): pp. 161–67. doi:10.1017/S1473550409004492.

>IR spectroscopy shows that nebulae (where stars come from) contain complex organic compounds (containing aromatic rings and aliphatic chains), synthesised on timescales of \~1,000 years. These compounds get dispersed throughout space and could have showered the Earth during the bombardment period in the Hadean.

>A model of the outer solar nebula (the dust clouds surrounding the solar system during its formation) found that the ice grains (containing H$_2$O, CO, CO$_2$, NH$_3$ and CH$_3$OH) would have been exposed to UV radiation and temperatures of \~30 K. Lab studies found that these same conditions lead to organic molecule formation including amino acids, lipids, quinones and nucleobases.

>An abiotic polypeptide has been detected identically in 6 different meteorites that landed on Earth, originally misidentified as 'hemolithin'. Hemoglycin contains 18 glycine (the simplest amino acid) and 4 hydroxyglycine (an abiotic, chiral amino acid) residues, and these were enantioenriched towards the D enantiomer. The residues formed a beta-pleated sheet and the terminal residues were bonded to iron(II) centres. Template self-replication by hydrogen bonding is proposed as the cause for the commonality between multiple meteorites. Hemoglycin has also been found in the sea foams which collect cosmic dust infall, with isotopic abundances indicating extraterrestrial origin.

>Salt minerals were found on the asteroid Bennu, including sodium phosphates, carbonates, sulfates, chlorides and fluorides, forming a frozen brine. These salts were present as components of calcite, magnetite, magnesite, apatite, dolomite and phyllosilicate clay minerals. Many of these minerals are relevant for catalysis of organic molecules.

\[A6\] Glavin, D. P. *et al.* (2025). '[**Abundant ammonia and nitrogen-rich soluble organic matter in samples from asteroid (101955) Bennu**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-024-02472-9)', *Nature Astronomy*. doi:10.1038/s41550-024-02472-9.

>Samples from the asteroid Bennu (from the same mission as \[A5\]) found several amino acids (glycine most abundant at 44 nmol/g, plus 19 other non-protein amino acids) and all five nucleobases, among a range of other relevant organics. Biological contamination was ruled out. All chiral amino acids observed were near-racemic.

\[A7\] Haas, S., Tutolo, B. M. and Catling, D. C. (2025). '[**Soda lake phosphorus fluxes controlled by biological uptake imply abundant phosphate in plausible origin-of-life environments**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016703725000626)', *Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta*, 393, pp.63-74. doi:10.1016/j.gca.2025.01.040.

>Phosphorus is required by all life (e.g. in RNA), but it is scarcely bioavailable in natural environments (the 'phosphorus problem'). It is known that iron-rich volcanic rocks can react with hot water or steam to form a range of phosphates, and that evaporation of resulting solutions can concentrate the phosphorus compounds. In sodium-carbonate (soda)-rich evaporative lakes with nearby volcanic activity, carbonates bind Ca$^{2+}$, preventing it from precipitating phosphate and allowing phosphorus to reach concentrations up to several millimolar. This is a prebiotically plausible solution to the phosphate problem. Phosphate-rich lakes may have preferentially formed on the prebiotic earth because of carbonic acid weathering under CO$_2$-rich atmospheres.

\[A8\] Priye, A. *et al.* (2017). '[**Synchronized chaotic targeting and acceleration of surface chemistry in prebiotic hydrothermal microenvironments**](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1612924114)', *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, 114(6), pp. 1275–1280. doi:10.1073/pnas.1612924114.

>Synthesis of polymers typically requires monomers to be concentrated in the same place, but the vast volume of the prebiotic ocean would presumably dilute the chemicals within. However, the turbulent flows driven by thermal convection from subsea hydrothermal vents allow for mixing of chemical species in the bulk water while concentrating them at microporous mineral surfaces, enhancing surface reaction kinetics by a factor of ~1000. This effect was studied both by simulation and with microfluidics-based experiments.

\[A9\] Barge, L. M. and Price, R. E. (2023). '[**Diverse geochemical conditions for prebiotic chemistry in shallow-sea alkaline hydrothermal vents**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-022-01067-1)', *Nature Geoscience*, 15, pp.976-981. doi:10.1038/s41561-022-01067-1.

>Shallow pools and hydrothermal vents are often proposed as sites for prebiotic chemistry, and several sites are known where both conditions exist together in the same place. Conditions at these shallow hydrothermal fields include wet-dry cycling, temperature variations and influxes of both saltwater and freshwater. This may remove the need for long-distance mass transport, allowing prebiotic chemistry to overcome the 'dilution problem'.

## HOMOCHIRALITY

All chiral biogenic molecules are enantiomerically pure, existing as L-amino acids and D-sugars. A prebiotically plausible 'symmetry breaking' mechanism is therefore required to explain how racemic reactants were resolved. This may have occurred at the monomer or the polymer level.

\[B1\] Viedma, C. (2001) '[**Enantiomeric Crystallization from DL-Aspartic and DL-Glutamic Acids: Implications for Biomolecular Chirality in the Origin of Life**](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1012790523136)', *Origins of Life and Evolution of the Biosphere*, , 31(6), pp. 501–509. doi:10.1023/a:1012790523136.

>Supersaturated solutions of racemic aspartic acid (Asp) and glutamic acid (Glu) will crystallise as enantiopure crystal grains (conglomerates), since once an amino acid has nucleated, the crystal growth favours having the same enantiomer. This process increases the *ee* of the supernatant.

\[B2\] Tarasevych, A.V. *et al.* (2013) '[**Deracemization of amino acids by partial sublimation and via homochiral self-organization**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23690241/)', *Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres*, 43(2), pp. 129–135. doi:10.1007/s11084-013-9333-6.

>If enantiopure Asn/Asp/Glu/Ser/Thr and additional racemic amino acids form a supersaturated solution, which is then evaporated to form a solid, which is then sublimed at \~100 C, the resulting gas phase contains the enantioenriched amino acids i.e. the deracemisation effect in \[B1\] is extended to the other amino acids. The ee's obtained were highly variable due to the random nature of nucleation.

\[B3\] Kojo, S. *et al*. (2004). '[**Racemic D,L-asparagine causes enantiomeric excess of other coexisting racemic D,L-amino acids during recrystallization: a hypothesis accounting for the origin of L-amino acids in the biosphere**](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2004/cc/b409941a)'. Chemical Communications, (19), p.2146. doi:10.1039/b409941a.

>The deracemisation mechanism of amino acids in \[B1\] is extended to all other chiral amino acids. When a racemic solution of asparagine (Asn) and other amino acids co-crystallises, the resulting crystals were enantioenriched in both amino acids, with their *ee*'s strongly correlated. The range of *ee*'s obtained remains random and can be very high (up to 100% in some trials) in either direction.

\[B4\] Blackmond, D.G. and Klussmann, M. (2007) '[**Spoilt for choice: Assessing phase behavior models for the evolution of homochirality**](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2007/cc/b709314b)', *Chemical Communications*, (39), p. 3990. doi:10.1039/b709314b.

>Partially enantioenriched amino acid solutions (like those formed in \[B3\]) can recrystallise again, forming racemate crystals while the supernatant tends to the eutectic composition at thermodynamic equilibrium, which can have much higher *ee* (e.g. Ser > 99%, His = 93%, Leu = 87%)*.* This process can also occur exploiting differential volatility using sublimation/deposition (solid ↔ gas) instead of dissolution (solid ↔ aqueous). Also, amino acids with low eutectic *ee*'s (e.g. Pro = 50%, Val = 47%) can have these eutectic *ee*'s increased by co-crystallising with a small achiral hydrogen bond donor molecule (e.g. CHCl$_3$), rising to >90% ee. Suitable prebiotic environments proposed include warm pools of water containing amino acids with cycles of rainfall and evaporation, or in sublimating organic space dust brought to Earth.

\[B5\] Deng, M., Yu, J. and Blackmond, D.G. (2024) '[**Symmetry breaking and chiral amplification in prebiotic ligation reactions**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07059-y?fromPaywallRec=false)', *Nature*, 626(8001), pp. 1019–1024. doi:10.1038/s41586-024-07059-y.

>Amidonitriles react with amino acids in a ligation (joining) reaction, catalysed by a prebiotic achiral thiol, with faster reaction when the reactants have opposite chirality (promotes heterochiral products). When enantioenriched solutions of both reactants were used, the homochiral product predominated. Also, due to the difference in solubility of the homochiral and heterochiral products, the crystallisation effects in \[B3\] led to a solution of only homochiral products.

\[B6\] Yu, J. *et al.* (2024) '[**Prebiotic access to enantioenriched amino acids via peptide-mediated transamination reactions**](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2315447121)', *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, 121(7). doi:10.1073/pnas.2315447121.

>A variety of similar kinetic resolutions to \[B5\] are listed. Pyridoxamine and pyruvate react reversibly to form alanine and pyridoxal. When catalysed by dipeptides containing proline at low *ee*, the alanine becomes enantioenriched.

\[B7\] Hazen, R. M., Filley, T. R., & Goodfriend, G. A. (2001). '[**Selective adsorption of L- and D-amino acids on calcite: Implications for biochemical homochirality**](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.101085998)', *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, *98*(10), pp. 5487–5490. doi:10.1073/pnas.101085998.

>When calcite (CaCO$_3$) is immersed in a racemic aspartic acid solution, the L and D enantiomers adsorb onto different faces of the asymmetric crystal structure, giving *ee*'s up to \~10%. The microscopically localised *ee* values may be far higher than reported due to experimental artefacts.

>UV radiation from sunlight can be scattered and totally internally reflected at a water-air interface to form \~5% circular polarised radiation during late afternoon near the sea surface. At the higher sea surface temperatures in the afternoon, this radiation could melt RNA/DNA duplexes, with faster kinetics for strands containing more D-nucleotides due to the polarisation. Strands with D-nucleotides would become more available for template replication, selecting for more homochiral RNA/DNA. L-tryptophan also complexes enantioselectively with D-RNA, also increasing the *ee* of the tryptophan.

\[B9\] Globus, N., Fedynitch, A. and Blandford, R. (2021). '[**Polarized Radiation and the Emergence of Biological Homochirality on Earth and Beyond**](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abe461)', *The Astrophysical Journal, 910(85)*. doi:10.3847/1538-4357/abe461

>Cosmic rays form spin-polarised muons (due to the weak force's parity violation) that reach the surface. These could cause enantioselective mutagenesis in RNA/DNA or serve as another source of circularly polarised radiation.

\[B10\] Chen, Y., & Ma, W. (2020). '[**The origin of biological homochirality along with the origin of life**](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1007592)', *PLOS Computational Biology*, 16(1), pp. e1007592. doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007592

>Homochirality of RNA could arise at the polymer level rather than the monomer level, since polynucleotides preferentially polymerise with nucleotides of the same chirality, amplifying small initial imbalances. This was verified by computer simulation.

\[B11\] Hein, J. E.; Tse, E.; Blackmond, D. G. (2011). '[**A Route to Enantiopure RNA Precursors from Nearly Racemic Starting Materials**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21860459/)', *Nature Chemistry*, 3 (9), pp. 704–706. doi:10.1038/nchem.1108.

>When 1% *ee* L-proline is enantioenriched through the crystallisation process in \[B3\], it is able to catalyse the reaction between racemic glyceraldehyde and 2-amino-oxazole to form enantioenriched amino-oxazolines (AOs) at 20-80% *ee*. Another crystallisation gives enantiopure AOs. These AOs can be converted to enantiopure RNA nucleotides by the prebiotically plausible reactions (Sutherland-Powner type syntheses).

>Solar UV light can irradiate magnetite deposits to produced spin-polarised photoelectrons due to the spin-aligned magnetic domains. These helical electrons can carry out enantioselective redox reactions due to the chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect. This process is well-suited to carrying out cyanosulfide chemistry, forming simple sugars and hydroxy-aldehydes.

\[B13\] Lee, C. *et al.* (2022). '[**Chirality in Organic and Mineral Systems: A Review of Reactivity and Alteration Processes Relevant to Prebiotic Chemistry and Life Detection Missions**](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/14/3/460)'. *Symmetry*. 14(3):460. doi:10.3390/sym14030460

>A review of the wide range of reactions catalysed by (or involving adsorption to) minerals with enantiomorphic crystal surfaces, such as \[B7\].

\[B14\] Banerjee-Ghosh, K. *et al*. (2018). '[**Separation of enantiomers by their enantiospecific interaction with achiral magnetic substrates**](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aar4265)'. *Science*, 360(6395), pp.1331-1334. doi:10.1126/science.aar4265.

>Due to the CISS effect, α-helical oligopeptides and dsDNA oligonucleotides, as well as chiral amino acids, have enantiospecific differences in initial adsorption rates on ferromagnetic surfaces, depending on the direction of magnetisation. In combination with \[B12\], it complements the mechanism for CISS-mediated deracemisation.

\[B15\] Ozturk, S. F. *et al.* (2023). '[**Chirality-induced avalanche magnetization of magnetite by an RNA precursor**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-42130-8)'. *Nature Communications*, 14, 6351(2023). doi:10.1038/s41467-023-42130-8.

>Starting with racemic ribose-aminooxazoline (RAO, a relevant pyrimidine ribonucleoside precursor) and natural near-unmagnetised magnetite, a simple crystallisation and dissolution led to enantiopure RAO and the strong magnetisation of the magnetite substrate. This occurs due to the CISS effect, where spin-aligned domains preferentially absorb one enantiomer and promote domain growth in the magnetite, setting up a feedback loop. The resulting magnetic coercivity of the magnetite was 30 times the modern geomagnetic field (stronger than in the Hadean).

## AUTOCATALYSIS AND SYSTEMS CHEMISTRY

Studies on biochemical reactions in which the catalyst is also a product of the reaction, or another reaction in a closed set.

\[C1\] Hanopolskyi, A.I. *et al.* (2020) '[**Autocatalysis: Kinetics, Mechanisms and Design**](https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/syst.202000026)', *ChemSystemsChem*, 3(1). doi:10.1002/syst.202000026.

>A review of the general topic of autocatalysis. For an autocatalytic reaction $ A + B \rightleftharpoons 2 B $ (A: substrate, B: product and catalyst), the kinetics follow $ \frac{\mathrm{d} \[B\] }{\mathrm{d} t} \propto \[B\]^{1/2} $ when $ \[A\] $ is held constant (square root law). Includes a discussion of the autocatalytic nature of short RNAs (ribozymes), autocatalytic sets and autocatalytic cycles, and mentions the concept of hypercycles proposed by Eigen.

\[C2\] Hordijk, W. (2017). '[**Autocatalytic confusion clarified**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022519317304150?via%3Dihub)', *Journal of Theoretical Biology*, 435, pp. 22–28. doi:10.1016/j.jtbi.2017.09.003.

>Gives the definitions of autocatalytic sets and cycles, and discusses the relevance of autocatalytic sets for origin of life regarding self-replication, including both RNA-first and metabolism-first hypotheses. It is known that the metabolism in *E. coli* comprises a large autocatalytic set (and a specific type called a 'RAF set', satisfying rigorously-defined set-theoretic properties).

\[C3\] Mauksch, M. *et al.* (2009). '[**Spontaneous Mirror Symmetry Breaking in the Aldol Reaction and its Potential Relevance in Prebiotic Chemistry**](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11084-009-9177-2)'. *Orig Life Evol Biosph* 40, pp.79-91. doi:10.1007/s11084-009-9177-2.

>An example of asymmetric organoautocatalysis, slightly more prebiotically plausible than the related Soai reaction (Soai, 1995), which is the aldol condensation of acetone and p-nitrobenzaldehyde. An organic solvent (DMSO) was used, but aldol reactions are known to be feasible in water too. It is most relevant for homochirality of sugars, and it is proposed that such a reaction may be a non-enzymatic 'chemical ancestor' of the gluconeogenesis pathway.

\[C4\] Roszak, R. *et al.* (2024). '[**Emergence of metabolic-like cycles in blockchain-orchestrated reaction networks**](https://www.cell.com/chem/abstract/S2451-9294(23)00611-3)'. *Chem*, 10(3), pp.952–970. doi:10.1016/j.chempr.2023.12.009.

>A network of 4.9 billion prebiotically plausible reactions on small molecules was surveyed using distributed blockchain computing for cycle formation. About \~100 self-replicating cycles were identified. It is concluded that cycles were unlikely at the small molecule level, instead predominating at the macromolecule level.

\[C5\] Goldman, A.D. and Kacar B. (2021). '[**Cofactors are Remnants of Life's Origin and Early Evolution**](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7982383/)'. *Journal of Molecular Evolution*. 89(3):127-133. doi:10.1007/s00239-020-09988-4.

>Many cofactors of extant enzymes are chemically similar to nucleotides (e.g. acetyl CoA, S-adenosyl methionine, ATP, NADH, FAD, cAMP...), supporting the RNA first hypothesis, as they could have been catalytic active sites of ancient ribozymes which became cofactors when the surrounding ribozyme scaffolds were replaced by protein apoenzymes during the evolution of translation. Similar ideas hold for iron-sulfur cluster cofactors as remnants of geologic activity (e.g. iron-sulfur world hypothesis).

## NON-EQUILIBRIUM THERMODYNAMICS AND INFORMATION THEORY

Relevant concepts in the complexification of prebiotic chemistry, as suitable systems chemically evolve towards life.

\[D1\] Schneider, E.D. and Kay, J.J. (1994) '[**Life as a manifestation of the second law of Thermodynamics**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0895717794901880?via%3Dihub)', *Mathematical and Computer Modelling*, 19(6–8), pp. 25–48. doi:10.1016/0895-7177(94)90188-0. 

>Describes the '4th law of thermodynamics': an open system far from equilibrium will evolve in time so as to maximise the generation of entropy production in the surroundings. This makes low entropy self-organization an inevitable consequence if the non-equilibrium state is maintained, as the system seeks to dissipate gradients in Gibbs free energy imposed upon it. A common non-biological example is the formation of convection cells in confined fluids with strong applied thermal gradients.

\[D2\] Koonin, E.V. and Novozhilov, A.S. (2008) '[**Origin and evolution of the Genetic Code: The universal enigma**](https://iubmb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/iub.146)', *IUBMB Life*, 61(2), pp. 99–111. doi:10.1002/iub.146.

>The genetic translational code (codon table) is robust to translational errors due to redundancy, but many more possible robust codes exist, so the standard code could have arisen randomly, by a few steps of random codon series reassignments. The 'frozen accident hypothesis' is supported by the observation that some specific clades of extant life, as well as mtDNA, uses a range of genetic codes, all slightly differing in different ways.

>Purine nucleobases absorb in the UVB/C spectrum strongly and undergo rapid non-radiative decay, making them strong candidates for free energy dissipation. A non-equilibrium thermodynamic model is given for UV-light-mediated prebiotic reactions relevant to these purines, including isomerisations and tautomerisation required for their synthesis from HCN, nucleoside phosphorylation, and melting of dsRNA duplexes.

>Defines 'functional information' in biologically-useful context in terms of Shannon information entropy (roughly, how 'surprised' we are when observing a particular outcome from a distribution). It is defined for a given system and function (within the context of the system) as $ I(E_x) = -\log_2 F(E_x) $, where $ E_x $ is the degree of function and $ F(E_x) $ is the fraction of configurations in system with degree of function $ \geq E_x $. Different functions of the same biomolecule are available in different systems.

The probability to discover a self-replicator by random chance depends exponentially on the relative rate of formation of the monomers, and if rate at which monomers are formed is somewhat similar to the rate at which they would occur in a self-replicating polymer, the likelihood to discover such a replicator by chance is drastically increased (\~64 orders of magnitude). This is verified by computer simulation.

>A comprehensive review of the concept of 'code biology', exploring the origin of the genetic code and the RNA to protein translation system.

Among the purines, adenine has the highest resonance energy per pi electron, making it preferable for incorporation into RNA due to \[D3\]. Other purines, pyrimidines and urea also form with NCO$ ^-$ and C$ _2$N$ _2$. Acid hydrolysis of the mixture yields hydantoins (cylic carbamyl amino acids) and pteridines (similar to cofactors like riboflavins and pterins).

>A review summarising modern prebiotic lipid synthesis and reactions, including their phosphorylation, esterification and ligation with choline. Lipids are formed by Fischer-Tropsch-type reactions of simple gaseous precursors (CO, H$_2$O, H$_2$, CO$_2$), which in turn form from the thermal decomposition of formic acid and oxalic acid. This can form a diverse range of n-alkanes, straight/branched alkenes, fatty alcohols, fatty acids and fatty formyl esters. Triacyanocuprate and tetracyanocuprate can act as electron donors. Glycerol can be phosphorylated in a deep eutectic solvent of urea and choline chloride. Glycerol can form mono-, di- and triglycerides with hot fatty acids and various mineral catalysts. Since bilayer stability against Mg$ ^{2+}$ ions increases with phospholipid-to-lipid ratio, and Lipids form micelles while phospholipids form bilayers, this provides a selection mechanism for phospholipid membranes.

>Starting with ribonucleoside 2′,3′-cyclic phosphates (an easily formed prebiotic molecule), addition of aliphatic hydrophobic amino acids (such as L-valine, L-leucine, L-isoleucine, L-alanine, glycine) at pH 9-10 at room temperature, resulted in formation of up to 7-mer oligo-RNA. The cyclic nucleoside phosphate is more stable than 5'-nucleotides, making it more prebiotically plausible. The NMR data showed a bias towards 3'-5' linkages (about 60\%), the correct one for optimally functional/extant RNA. Polymerisation occurred in the dried state. No [Mg]$ ^{2+} $ ions were required. These conditions could be found in cooler volcanic environments, whose alkalinity is also correlated with phosphate enrichment, allowing wet-dry cycling to occur. Thermal gradients (heat fluxes) also selectively enrich Val/Leu/Ile as required. This completes the 'missing link' in the coevolution of RNA and proteins, as it shows that amino acids can promote RNA formation while RNA can promote protein formation.

>Prebiotically plausible syntheses of aminoacyl phosphate anhydrides are already known. Two strands of complementary oligo-RNAs were prepared, one of which is 5'-terminated with an aminoacyl phosphate. These short RNAs anneal together form a duplex, wherein the 3' and 5' ends are in close proximity. Transfer of the aminoacyl group occurs between the ends of the RNA with high enantioselectivity and chemoselectivity based on the amino acid, forming self-aminoacylated RNA. This provides an origin of extant aminoacyl-tRNA by duplication, which is necessary for genetically encoded protein synthesis. This mechanism is also compatible with the hypothesis that tRNA arose by duplication of RNA, as it has an antisymmetric cloverleaf structure.

>Several 7-mer oligopeptides were found to form a β-strands, in particular those with alternating hydrophilic-hydrophobic primary structure (e.g. LKLKLKL, L: leucine, K: lysine, with many others). When positions 2 and 4 were replaced with histidine (H), the β-strand structure was retained, and some of these peptides self-assembled into an amyloid fibril structure with β-pleated sheets, and exhibited catalytic activity for the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acetate (pNPA) in the presence of Zn(II) ions. These peptides work by binding Zn(II) ions with the histidine residue side chains, a motif found in many extant hydrolase enzymes. The sequence IHIHIQI was especially effective, with $ \frac{k_{cat}}{K_m} = 360 \ M^{-1} \ s^{-1} $ (quite high) at pH 10.3.

>A protocell model membrane is made from cationic surfactant molecules. When DNA and DNA polymerase is contained within, the resulting protocells undergo division and continued self-replication of the DNA in each protocell.

>Experiments show lipid-encapsulated polymers can be synthesized by cycles of hydration and dehydration to form protocells. Protocells cycling through wet, dry, and moist phases will subject polymers to combinatorial selection and create structural and catalytic functions out of initially random sequences, including structural stabilisation, pore formation, and primitive metabolic activity.

>Chemical gradients in simple mixtures of activated amino acids and fatty acids form of amyloid-like peptide fibres that get contained within lipid vesicles. The lipid vesicles act both as a semi-permeable membrane, allowing selective passage of activated amino acids, while blocking diffusion of amyloidogenic peptides that form spontaneously within.

>Cysteine reacts with a 8-carbon thioester of choline in water at pH 8 to form a two-tailed amphiphile (a diacylcysteine), which forms membrane bilayer vesicles in the presence of a silica substrate. This occurred at concentrations far below the critical micelle concentration (CMC). Peptides with an *N*\-terminal cysteine residue were also capable of reaction and vesicle formation, with faster kinetics and lower CMC. The vesicles were stable in divalent cation solution up to 2 mM Mg(II) and 10 mM Ca(II). Aminoacylating ribozymes (using biotinyl-Tyr(Me)-oxazolone as their substrate) encapsulated within the vesicles retained their functionality.

>Lipid bilayers encapsulating homochiral Leu-Leu, Leu-Gly and Leu-Ser dipeptides grew to larger sizes and were more stable to salt-induced flocculation than those encapsulating heterochiral dipeptides, which led to leaky vesicles. This provides a selection mechanism for homochirality in vesicle-bound dipeptides.

Sci. U.S.A.*, 122(22), e2412514122, doi:10.1073/pnas.2412514122.

>Abiotic vesicles were created in water from a mixture of 1) PEG terminated with a hydrophobic chain transfer agent (an amphiphile), 2) monomers such as acrylonitrile (photopolymerisable to form block copolymers with PEG), 3) zinc tetraphenylporphyrin (a photocatalyst), in the presence of visible light. This represents a far-from-equilibrium system with robust dynamics. The polymers assemble into micelles enclosing the reactive monomers. These vesicles evolve in time through feedback between polymerisation, degradation and chemiosmotic gradients, resulting in self-reproduction. As vesicles grow, they polymerise their contents, leading to their partial release and their reproduction into new vesicles, exhibiting a loose form of heritable variation, competitive exclusion and Darwinian selection.

## SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY

Experiments on cells derived from extant biology. These are usually not prebiotically relevant, but can inform us about the minimum viable complexity of simple cells.

>Building on Craig Venter's 2010 work creating synthetic cells derived from the bacteria *Mycoplasma mycoides*, a new type of synthetic minimal cell (JCVI-syn3.0) is created. These cells contain \~500 genes and undergo normal cell division with spherical cell shape.

## ASTROBIOLOGY AND ASTROCHEMISTRY

Chemical reactions occurring in space, forming the 'building blocks of the building blocks' that were likely present at Earth's formation, or were delivered during the bombardment period that followed.

\[A1\] Kwok, Sun. (2009) ‘[**\~Delivery of Complex Organic Compounds from Planetary Nebulae to the Solar System.\~**](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-journal-of-astrobiology/article/abs/delivery-of-complex-organic-compounds-from-planetary-nebulae-to-the-solar-system/673B6EF557061150FA26DB1A7760FDC0)’ *International Journal of Astrobiology*, 8(3): pp. 161–67. doi:10.1017/S1473550409004492.

>IR spectroscopy shows that nebulae (where stars come from) contain complex organic compounds (containing aromatic rings and aliphatic chains), synthesised on timescales of \~1,000 years. These compounds get dispersed throughout space and could have showered the Earth during the bombardment period in the Hadean.

\[A2\] Ciesla, F.J. and Sandford, S.A. (2012) ‘[**\~Organic synthesis via irradiation and warming of ice grains in the solar nebula\~**](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1217291)’, *Science*, 336(6080), pp. 452–454. doi:10.1126/science.1217291.

>A model of the outer solar nebula (the dust clouds surrounding the solar system during its formation) found that the ice grains (containing H2O, CO, CO2, NH3 and CH3OH) would have been exposed to UV radiation and temperatures of \~30 K. Lab studies found that these same conditions lead to organic molecule formation including amino acids, lipids, quinones and nucleobases.

\[A3\] Schaible, M. J. *et al*. (2024). ‘[**\~The Astrobiology Primer v3.0\~**](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/ast.2021.0129)’. *Astrobiology*, 24(S1), doi:10.1089/ast.2021.0129

>Discusses a wide variety of geochemical processes that were present on the early Earth, that provided sources of inorganic chemicals and energy gradients.

\[A4\] McGeoch, J. E. M., & McGeoch, M. W. (2022). ‘[**\~Chiral 480 nm absorption in the hemoglycin space polymer: a possible link to replication\~**](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-21043-4)‘, *Scientific reports*, 12(1), 16198. doi:10.1038/s41598-022-21043-4.

>An abiotic polypeptide has been detected identically in 6 different meteorites that landed on Earth, originally misidentified as 'hemolithin'. Hemoglycin contains glycine (the simplest amino acid) and hydroxyglycine (an abiotic, chiral amino acid) residues, and these were enantioenriched towards the D enantiomer (rather than L). The residues formed a beta-pleated sheet and the terminal residues were bonded to iron(II) centres. Template self-replication by hydrogen bonding is proposed as the cause for the commonality between multiple meteorites. Hemoglycin has also been found in the sea foams which collect cosmic dust infall, with isotopic abundances indicating extraterrestrial origin.

\[A5\] McCoy, T. J., Russell, S. S., Zega, T. J. *et al.* (2025). ‘[**\~An evaporite sequence from ancient brine recorded in Bennu samples\~**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08495-6)‘, *Nature* 637, 1072–1077. doi:10.1038/s41586-024-08495-6.

>Salt minerals were found on the asteroid Bennu, including sodium phosphates, carbonates, sulfates, chlorides and fluorides, forming a frozen brine. These salts were present as components of calcite, magnetite, magnesite, apatite, dolomite and phyllosilicate clay minerals. Many of these minerals are relevant for catalysis of organic molecules.

\[A6\] Glavin, D. P. *et al.* (2025). ‘[**\~Abundant ammonia and nitrogen-rich soluble organic matter in samples from asteroid (101955) Bennu\~**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-024-02472-9)‘, *Nature Astronomy*. doi:10.1038/s41550-024-02472-9.

>Samples from the asteroid Bennu (from the same mission as \[A5\]) found several amino acids (glycine most abundant at 44 nmol/g, plus 19 other non-protein amino acids) and all five nucleobases, among a range of other relevant organics. Biological contamination was ruled out. All chiral amino acids observed were near-racemic.

## HOMOCHIRALITY

All chiral biogenic molecules are enantiomerically pure, existing as L-amino acids and D-sugars. A prebiotically plausible 'symmetry breaking' mechanism is therefore required to explain how racemic reactants were resolved. This may have occurred at the monomer or the polymer level.

\[B1\] Viedma, C. (2001) ‘[**\~Enantiomeric Crystallization from DL-Aspartic and DL-Glutamic Acids: Implications for Biomolecular Chirality in the Origin of Life\~**](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1012790523136)’, *Origins of Life and Evolution of the Biosphere*, , 31(6), pp. 501–509. doi:10.1023/a:1012790523136.

>Supersaturated solutions of racemic aspartic acid (Asp) and glutamic acid (Glu) will crystallise as enantiopure crystal grains (conglomerates), since once an amino acid has nucleated, the crystal growth favours having the same enantiomer. This process increases the *ee* of the supernatant.

\[B2\] Tarasevych, A.V. *et al.* (2013) ‘[**\~Deracemization of amino acids by partial sublimation and via homochiral self-organization\~**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23690241/)’, *Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres*, 43(2), pp. 129–135. doi:10.1007/s11084-013-9333-6.

>If enantiopure Asn/Asp/Glu/Ser/Thr and additional racemic amino acids form a supersaturated solution, which is then evaporated to form a solid, which is then sublimed at \~100 C, the resulting gas phase contains the enantioenriched amino acids i.e. the deracemisation effect in \[B1\] is extended to the other amino acids. The ee's obtained were highly variable due to the random nature of nucleation.

\[B3\] Kojo, S. *et al*. (2004). ‘[**\~Racemic d,l-asparagine causes enantiomeric excess of other coexisting racemic d,l-amino acids during recrystallization: a hypothesis accounting for the origin of l-amino acids in the biosphere\~**](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2004/cc/b409941a)’. Chemical Communications, (19), p.2146. doi:10.1039/b409941a.

>The deracemisation mechanism of amino acids in \[B1\] is extended to all other chiral amino acids. When a racemic solution of asparagine (Asn) and other amino acids co-crystallises, the resulting crystals were enantioenriched in both amino acids, with their *ee*'s strongly correlated. The range of *ee*'s obtained remains random and can be very high (up to 100% in some trials) in either direction.

\[B4\] Blackmond, D.G. and Klussmann, M. (2007) ‘[**\~Spoilt for choice: Assessing phase behavior models for the evolution of homochirality\~**](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2007/cc/b709314b)’, *Chemical Communications*, (39), p. 3990. doi:10.1039/b709314b.

>Partially enantioenriched amino acid solutions (like those formed in \[B3\]) can recrystallise again, forming racemate crystals while the supernatant tends to the eutectic composition at thermodynamic equilibrium, which can have much higher *ee* (e.g. Ser > 99%, His = 93%, Leu = 87%)*.* This process can also occur exploiting differential volatility using sublimation/deposition (solid ↔ gas) instead of dissolution (solid ↔ aqueous). Also, amino acids with low eutectic *ee*'s (e.g. Pro = 50%, Val = 47%) can have these eutectic *ee*'s increased by co-crystallising with a small achiral hydrogen bond donor molecule (e.g. CHCl3), rising to >90% ee. Suitable prebiotic environments proposed include warm pools of water containing amino acids with cycles of rainfall and evaporation, or in sublimating organic space dust brought to Earth.

\[B5\] Deng, M., Yu, J. and Blackmond, D.G. (2024) ‘[**\~Symmetry breaking and chiral amplification in prebiotic ligation reactions\~**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07059-y?fromPaywallRec=false)’, *Nature*, 626(8001), pp. 1019–1024. doi:10.1038/s41586-024-07059-y.

>Amidonitriles react with amino acids in a ligation (joining) reaction, catalysed by a prebiotic achiral thiol, with faster reaction when the reactants have opposite chirality (promotes heterochiral products). When enantioenriched solutions of both reactants were used, the homochiral product predominated. Also, due to the difference in solubility of the homochiral and heterochiral products, the crystallisation effects in \[B3\] led to a solution of only homochiral products.

\[B6\] Yu, J. *et al.* (2024) ‘[**\~Prebiotic access to enantioenriched amino acids via peptide-mediated transamination reactions\~**](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2315447121)’, *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, 121(7). doi:10.1073/pnas.2315447121.

>A variety of similar kinetic resolutions to \[B5\] are listed. Pyridoxamine and pyruvate react reversibly to form alanine and pyridoxal. When catalysed by dipeptides containing proline at low *ee*, the alanine becomes enantioenriched.

\[B7\] Hazen, R. M., Filley, T. R., & Goodfriend, G. A. (2001). ‘[**\~Selective adsorption of L- and D-amino acids on calcite: Implications for biochemical homochirality\~**](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.101085998)’, *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, *98*(10), pp. 5487–5490. doi:10.1073/pnas.101085998.

>When calcite (CaCO3) is immersed in a racemic aspartic acid solution, the L and D enantiomers adsorb onto different faces of the asymmetric crystal structure, giving *ee*'s up to \~10%. The microscopically localised *ee* values may be far higher than reported due to experimental artefacts.

\[B8\] Michaelian K. (2018). ‘[**\~Homochirality through Photon-Induced Denaturing of RNA/DNA at the Origin of Life\~**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6027432/)‘. *Life (Basel, Switzerland)*, *8*(2), 21. doi:10.3390/life8020021.

>UV radiation from sunlight can be scattered and totally internally reflected at a water-air interface to form \~5% circular polarisated radiation during late afternoon near the sea surface. At the higher sea surface temperatures in the afternoon, this radiation could melt RNA/DNA duplexes, with faster kinetics for strands containing more D-nucleotides due to the polarisation. Strands with D-nucleotides would become more available for template replication, selecting for more homochiral RNA/DNA.

\[B9\] Globus, N., Fedynitch, A. and Blandford, R. (2021). ‘[**\~Polarized Radiation and the Emergence of Biological Homochirality on Earth and Beyond\~**](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abe461)‘, *The Astrophysical Journal, 910(85)*. doi:10.3847/1538-4357/abe461

>Cosmic rays form spin-polarised muons (due to the weak force's parity violation) that reach the surface. These could cause enantioselective mutagenesis in RNA/DNA or serve as another source of circularly polarised radiation.

\[B10\] Chen, Y., & Ma, W. (2020). ‘[**\~The origin of biological homochirality along with the origin of life\~**](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1007592)’, *PLOS Computational Biology*, 16(1), pp. e1007592. doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007592

>Homochirality of RNA could arise at the polymer level rather than the monomer level, since polynucleotides preferentially polymerise with nucleotides of the same chirality, amplifying small initial imbalances. This was verified by computer simulation.

\[B11\] Hein, J. E.; Tse, E.; Blackmond, D. G. (2011). ‘[**\~A Route to Enantiopure RNA Precursors from Nearly Racemic Starting Materials\~**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21860459/)’, *Nature Chemistry*, 3 (9), pp. 704–706. doi:10.1038/nchem.1108.

>When 1% *ee* L-proline is enantioenriched through the crystallisation process in \[B3\], it is able to catalyse the reaction between racemic glyceraldehyde and 2-amino-oxazole to form enantioenriched amino-oxazolines (AOs) at 20-80% *ee*. Another crystallisation gives enantiopure AOs. These AOs can be converted to enantiopure RNA nucleotides by the prebiotically plausible reactions (Sutherland-Powner type syntheses).

>Solar UV light can irradiate magnetite deposits to produced spin-polarised photoelectrons due to the spin-aligned magnetic domains. These helical electrons can carry out enantioselective redox reactions due to the chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect. This process is well-suited to carrying out cyanosulfide chemistry, forming simple sugars and hydroxy-aldehydes.

>A review of the wide range of reactions catalysed by (or involving adsorption to) minerals with enantiomorphic crystal surfaces, such as \[B7\].

## AUTOCATALYSIS AND SYSTEMS CHEMISTRY

Studies on biochemical reactions in which the catalyst is also a product of the reaction, or another reaction in a closed set.

\[C1\] Hanopolskyi, A.I. *et al.* (2020) ‘[**\~Autocatalysis: Kinetics, Mechanisms and Design\~**](https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/syst.202000026)’, *ChemSystemsChem*, 3(1). doi:10.1002/syst.202000026.

>A review of the general topic of autocatalysis. For an autocatalytic reaction A + B ⇌ 2 B (A: substrate, B: product and catalyst), the kinetics follow d\[B\]/dt ∝ \[B\]\^(1/2) when \[A\] is held constant (square root law). Includes a discussion of the autocatalytic nature of short RNAs (ribozymes), autocatalytic sets and autocatalytic cycles, and mentions the concept of hypercycles proposed by Eigen.

\[C2\] Hordijk, W. (2017). ‘[**\~Autocatalytic confusion clarified\~**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022519317304150?via%3Dihub)’, *Journal of Theoretical Biology*, 435, pp. 22–28. doi:10.1016/j.jtbi.2017.09.003.

>Gives the definitions of autocatalytic sets and cycles, and discusses the relevance of autocatalytic sets for origin of life regarding self-replication, including both RNA-first and metabolism-first hypotheses. It is known that the metabolism in *E. coli* comprises a large autocatalytic set (and a specific type called a 'RAF set', satisfying rigorously-defined set-theoretic properties).

\[C3\] Mauksch, M. *et al.* (2009). ‘[**\~Spontaneous Mirror Symmetry Breaking in the Aldol Reaction and its Potential Relevance in Prebiotic Chemistry\~**](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11084-009-9177-2)‘. *Orig Life Evol Biosph* 40, pp.79-91. doi:10.1007/s11084-009-9177-2.

>An example of asymmetric organoautocatalysis, slightly more prebiotically plausible than the related Soai reaction (Soai, 1995), which is the aldol condensation of acetone and p-nitrobenzaldehyde. An organic solvent (DMSO) was used, but aldol reactions are known to be feasible in water too. It is most relevant for homochirality of sugars, and it is proposed that such a reaction may be a non-enzymatic 'chemical ancestor' of the gluconeogenesis pathway.

\[C4\] Roszak, R. *et al.* (2024). ’[**\~Emergence of metabolic-like cycles in blockchain-orchestrated reaction networks\~**](https://www.cell.com/chem/abstract/S2451-9294(23)00611-3)’. *Chem*, 10(3), pp.952–970. doi:10.1016/j.chempr.2023.12.009.

>A network of 4.9 billion prebiotically plausible reactions on small molecules was surveyed using distributed blockchain computing for cycle formation. About \~100 self-replicating cycles were identified. It is concluded that cycles were unlikely at the small molecule level, instead predominating at the macromolecule level.

\[C5\] Goldman, A.D. and Kacar B. (2021). ‘[**\~Cofactors are Remnants of Life's Origin and Early Evolution\~**](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7982383/)‘. *Journal of Molecular Evolution*. 89(3):127-133. doi:10.1007/s00239-020-09988-4.

>Many cofactors of extant enzymes are chemically similar to nucleotides (e.g. acetyl CoA, S-adenosyl methionine, ATP, NADH, FAD, cAMP...), supporting the RNA first hypothesis, as they could have been catalytic active sites of ancient ribozymes which became cofactors when the surrounding ribozyme scaffolds were replaced by protein apoenzymes during the evolution of translation. Similar ideas hold for iron-sulfur cluster cofactors as remnants of geologic activity (e.g. iron-sulfur world hypothesis).

## NON-EQUILIBRIUM THERMODYNAMICS AND INFORMATION THEORY

Relevant concepts in the complexification of prebiotic chemistry, as suitable systems chemically evolve towards life.

\[D1\] Schneider, E.D. and Kay, J.J. (1994) ‘[**\~Life as a manifestation of the second law of Thermodynamics\~**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0895717794901880?via%3Dihub)’, *Mathematical and Computer Modelling*, 19(6–8), pp. 25–48. doi:10.1016/0895-7177(94)90188-0. 

>Describes the '4th law of thermodynamics': an open system far from equilibrium will evolve in time so as to maximise its entropy production. This makes self-organization an inevitable consequence if the non-equilibrium condition is maintained, as the system seeks to dissipate gradients in Gibbs free energy imposed upon it.

\[D2\] Koonin, E.V. and Novozhilov, A.S. (2008) ‘[**\~Origin and evolution of the Genetic Code: The universal enigma\~**](https://iubmb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/iub.146)’, *IUBMB Life*, 61(2), pp. 99–111. doi:10.1002/iub.146.

>The genetic translational code (codon table) is robust to translational errors due to redundancy, but many more possible robust codes exist, so the standard code could have arisen randomly, by a few steps of random codon series reassignments. The 'frozen accident hypothesis' is supported by the observation that some specific clades of extant life, as well as mtDNA, uses a range of genetic codes, all slightly differing in different ways.

\[D3\] Michaelian, K. (2017) ‘[**\~Microscopic dissipative structuring and proliferation at the origin of life\~**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844017319060)’, *Heliyon*, 3(10). doi:10.1016/j.heliyon.2017.e00424.

>Purine nucleobases absorb in the UVB/C spectrum strongly and undergo rapid non-radiative decay, making them strong candidates for free energy dissipation. A non-equilibrium thermodynamic model is given for UV-light-mediated prebiotic reactions relevant to these purines, including isomerisations and tautomerisation required for their synthesis from HCN, nucleoside phosphorylation, and melting of dsRNA duplexes.

\[D4\] Michaelian K. (2023) ‘[**\~The Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics of Natural Selection: From Molecules to the Biosphere\~**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10378079/)’. *Entropy (Basel, Switzerland)*, 25(7), 1059. doi:10.3390/e25071059.

>The non-equilibrium thermodynamic model is extended to all organised systems with a continuous free energy input, and can provide a physical basis for both chemical and biological (natural) selection.

\[D5\] Hazen, M. *et al*. (2007) ‘[**\~Functional information and the emergence of biocomplexity\~**](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.0701744104)‘. *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, 104(suppl\_1), pp. 8574-8581. doi:10.1073/pnas.0701744104.

>Defines 'functional information' in biologically-useful context in terms of Shannon information entropy (roughly, how 'surprised' we are when observing a particular outcome from a distribution). It is defined for a given system and function (within the context of the system). Functional information represents the probability that an arbitrary configuration of a system will achieve a specific function to a specified degree. Different functions of the same biomolecule are available in different systems.

\[D6\] Adami, C. (2015) ‘[**\~Information-Theoretic Considerations Concerning the Origin of Life\~**](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11084-015-9439-0)‘. *Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres*, 45, pp. 309–317. doi:10.1007/s11084-015-9439-0.

>The probability of spontaneous molecular self-replication is a function of the information contained in the replicator. The probability to discover a self-replicator by random chance depends exponentially on the relative rate of formation of the monomers, and if rate at which monomers are formed is somewhat similar to the rate at which they would occur in a self-replicating polymer, the likelihood to discover such a replicator by chance is drastically increased (\~64 orders of magnitude). This is verified by computer simulation.

## SYNTHESIS OF SMALL MOLECULES

Feasible reaction schemes based on experimental evidence to produce amino acids, sugars and nucleotides, with enantioselectivity and regioselectivity where relevant.

>A variety of experiments studying reactions and processes in 'prebiotic soups' (mixtures of glycine, L-alanine, L-aspartic acid, L-valine, nucleobases, sodium phosphate, glycerol, myristic acid, dodecanoic acid...) in geologically active regions. Observations include adsorption of molecules on smectite-kaolinite clay particle suspensions, soapy froth formation, polymerisation and encapsulation of polymers within lipid particles, amphiphile self-assembly and enzyme-free nucleotide polymerisation with wet-dry cycling.

>The formose reaction is autocatalytic, starting from formaldehyde, but produces a messy range of sugar molecules (trioses, tetroses, pentoses). By repeatedly sampling from the product mixture and adding it to a new reactant mixture, in the presence of minerals, the range of products decreases over multiple cycles. This increases the proportion of the 'useful' sugar products, including ribose.

>Reaction of formaldehyde with glycolaldehyde to form glyceraldehyde in up to 20% *ee* in the D-enantiomer at 20 C when enantiopure L-amino acids were present in small amounts. This would lead to D-sugar formation (e.g. D-ribose) in formose reactions. The enantiopurity of the glyceraldehyde can be increased by evaporation, due to differential solubility. Ribose does not have this differential solubility property, although ribose-containing nucleosides do, permitting their amplification.

>Fluid circulating in tectonic fault zones contains water and supercritical CO2, a well-known solvent for extraction and amphiphile nanoparticle synthesis in organic chemistry. This fluid would be supplied with hydrothermally formed compounds, is protected against dilution effects and destructive UV radiation, provides steady conditions over long timescales, generates structures which are highly selective for amphiphilic compounds such as lipids or peptides composed of hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acids, and has access to the 'warm little pond' environments at the surface.

## REACTIONS OF MACRMOLECULES

Studies on the reactions that macromolecules can undergo in prebiotically feasible conditions, typically leading to the development of self-replicators and other autocatalytic activity.

>Mixtures of RNA fragments that self-assemble into self-replicating ribozymes spontaneously form cooperative catalytic cycles and networks. When such cooperative networks are competed directly against selfish autocatalytic cycles, the former grow faster, indicating an intrinsic ability of RNA populations to evolve greater complexity through cooperation.

>A ribozyme is studied for its long-term evolution capacity. The RNA diversifies into multiple coexisting 'host' and 'parasite' 'lineages', whose frequencies in the population initially fluctuate and gradually stabilise. The final population, comprising five RNA lineages, forms a replicator network with diverse interactions, including cooperation to help the replication of all other members.

>The self-assembly of short peptides into β-sheet amyloids leads to structural stability.

>Polyribonucleotides do not require 3'-5' linkage regioselectivity to have ribozyme functionality. The 2'-5'/3'-5' heterogeneity lowers the melting point of the RNA duplexes, making thermal strand separation easier and permitting continued replication.

>Ribozyme activity is greatly enhanced by charge-mediated phase separation with poly-L-lysine. This shifts the reaction equilibrium from cleavage in solution to ligation in peptide-RNA co-aggregates and coacervates. This compartmentalization enables robust isothermal RNA assembly over a broad range of conditions.

>Prebiotically plausible syntheses of aminoacyl phosphate anhydrides are already known. Two strands of complementary oligo-RNAs were prepared, one of which is 5'-terminated with an aminoacyl phosphate. These short RNAs anneal together form a duplex, wherein the 3' and 5' ends are in close proximity. Transfer of the aminoacyl group occurs between the ends of the RNA with high enantioselectivity and chemoselectivity based on the amino acid, forming self-aminoacylated RNA. This provides an origin of extant aminoacyl-tRNA by duplication, which is necessary for genetically encoded protein synthesis. This mechanism is also compatible with the hypothesis that tRNA arose by duplication of RNA, as it has an antisymmetric cloverleaf structure.

>Chemical gradients in simple mixtures of activated amino acids and fatty acids form of amyloid-like peptide fibres that get contained within lipid vesicles.

>Cysteine reacts with a 8-carbon thioester of choline in water at pH 8 to form a two-tailed amphiphile (a diacylcysteine), which forms membrane bilayer vesicles in the presence of a silica substrate. This occurred at concentrations far below the critical micelle concentration (CMC). Peptides with an *N*\-terminal cysteine residue were also capable of reaction and vesicle formation, with faster kinetics and lower CMC. The vesicles were stable in divalent cation solution up to 2 mM Mg(II) and 10 mM Ca(II). Aminoacylating ribozymes (using biotinyl-Tyr(Me)-oxazolone as their substrate) encapsulated within the vesicles retained their functionality.

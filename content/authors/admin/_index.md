Hi! I'm an engineering graduate student at University of Cambridge, UK. Currently working in the Biointerface research group on my MEng project in the Nanoscience Centre developing a magnetically-actuated hydrogel lung organoid.

My website showcases the main projects I've worked on both at university and independently, in which I explore engineering, biochemistry, scientific computing, software development, machine learning, and whatever else I feel like digging into.

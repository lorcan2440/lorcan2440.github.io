Welcome! I'm a graduate engineer living in Wales, UK.

My website showcases the main projects I've worked on and experience I've gained both at university, as part of my career, and independently. While I work torwards my engineering career, my interdisciplinary background gives me the curiosity to also enjoy studying science and beyond as well.

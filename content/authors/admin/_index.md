Hi! I'm an engineering graduate student from Leeds, UK. Currently working as a research intern in the Bio-Inspired Robotics Lab at Cambridge. Returning to the University of Cambridge to complete my Master's degree in bioengineering later this year.

My website showcases the main projects I've worked on both at university and independently, in which I explore engineering, biochemistry, scientific computing, software development, machine learning, and whatever else I feel like digging into.

Hi! I'm a recent engineering graduate living in Leeds, UK after finishing my Master's degree in bioengineering and mechanical engineering at the University of Cambridge. I'm currently heading into a Graduate Engineering role at Scottish Power.

My website showcases the main projects I've worked on and experience I've gained both at university and independently.

I enjoy studying topics across the union of engineering, scientific computing, biotech and machine learning.

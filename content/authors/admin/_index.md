Hi! I'm a graduate engineer living in Wrexham, UK after finishing my Master's degree in bioengineering and mechanical engineering at the University of Cambridge.

My website showcases the main projects I've worked on and experience I've gained both at university and independently. While I work torwards an interdisciplinary engineering career, I also enjoy studying across science as well.

Hi! I'm a recent engineering graduate living in Leeds, UK after finishing my Master's degree in bioengineering at the University of Cambridge. 

[My website](https://lorcan.netlify.app/) showcases the main projects I've worked on and experience I've gained both at university and independently. I enjoy studying topics across the union of engineering, scientific computing, biotechnology and machine learning, any and all of which I have interests in pursuing as careers.

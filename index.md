Hi! I’m a 3rd-year engineering student from Leeds, UK. For the academic year 2022-23, I’m on a year abroad exchange programme at the National University of Singapore (NUS), before returning to the University of Cambridge to complete my Master’s degree in engineering (discipline TBC - likely bioengineering).

[My website](https://lorcan.netlify.app/) showcases the main projects I’ve worked on both at university and independently, in which I explore engineering, biochemistry, scientific computing, software development and machine learning, any and all of which I have interests in pursuing as careers.
